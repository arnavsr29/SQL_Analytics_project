# SQL Data Analytics Project (SQL Server)

## Project Overview

This project follows a complete SQL analytics lifecycle using SQL Server.  
The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data structure, dimensions, measures, date ranges, and overall data quality.

Once the data is validated, the project progresses into advanced analytics, including:
- Change-over-time analysis
- Cumulative analysis
- Performance analysis
- Part-to-whole analysis
- Data segmentation

The objective is to simulate how data analysts answer real business questions using SQL Server, focusing on analytical reasoning rather than simple data retrieval.  
The final outputs emphasize actionable insights and structured reporting that support data-driven decision-making for business stakeholders.

- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- T-SQL
- Window Functions
- Aggregations & Ranking
- Conditional Logic (CASE statements)

## Key Analytics Performed
- Exploratory data analysis
- KPI and metric calculations
- Time-based trend analysis
- Cumulative and part-to-whole analysis
- Customer and product segmentation

## How to Run & Verify everything
1. Create database in SQL Server
2. Import datasets
3. Schema Validation as it correct data types and date columns etc.
4. Execute SQL scripts in SSMS
5. Review results in the results folder

## Business Value
The analysis provides insights into performance drivers, trends, and high-impact segments, supporting data-driven business decisions.

## Biggest Insight
A small percentage of customers/products contributed to a large portion of revenue, highlighting optimization opportunities.
